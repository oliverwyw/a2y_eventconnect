Â  In 1966, the City of Saline, Michigan entered into a Sister City relationship with the city of Brecon, Wales.Â  The residents of the City of Saline have always had an interest in culture and arts, and this interest has been well-fed by the relationship with Brecon. Beginning in 1996, as part of the celebration of thirty years as the Sister City of Brecon, Wales, the City of Saline created the Saline Celtic Festival.Â  An enormous (and unexpected) amount of interest in repeating the festival in subsequent years caused it to blossom and grow into a significant event in the world of culture and music education, performances and exhibitions, as well as a well-recognized destination for those interested in other cultural aspects such as dance, theater, storytelling, and sporting events.Â  Each year more than 350Â local volunteers contribute hundreds of hours over the course of a year planning and implementing the festival. There is no paid administrative staff and no city tax dollars are spentÂ on the Festival.
