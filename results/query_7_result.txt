Description: Handel composed his oratorio Messiah over the course of a single month in 1741, six months before its triumphant premiere at a new concert hall in Dublin. Nearly 300 years later, Handelâs Messiah fills Hill Auditorium with its ravishing beauty brought to life by friends and colleagues from the community. Music director Scott Hanoian conducts the UMS Choral Union and the Ann Arbor Symphony Orchestra in this annual holiday tradition.

Berliner Philharmoniker

Description: For his debut concert, he conducts Andrew Normanâs 10-minute orchestra joyride, Unstuck, which brims with invention and energy. The orchestraâs first concertmaster, American Noah Bendix-Balgley, takes the stage for Mozartâs first violin concerto before the orchestra concludes its program with Erich Korngoldâs only symphony â a work that the composer never heard performed live. Completed in 1952 and dedicated to the memory of Franklin Delano Roosevelt, the work had a radio premiere in 1954 and was not performed live until 1972, 15 years after the composerâs death. Korngoldâs sweeping orchestrations and brilliant orchestral color made him a huge success in Hollywood as a film composer, all of which are on display in this insightful and dramatic score.The Berlin Philharmonicâs second program features Gustav Mahler at his most mysterious, with the tantalizing nocturnal atmosphere of his Symphony No. 7. The work, which remains the least known and least performed of all of Mahlerâs symphonies, was composed during the summers of 1904 and 1905, Mahlerâs only respite from the demands of conducting. The workâs wide palette of orchestral colors is filled with shadows and contrasts, and it had a mixed reception when it premiered in Prague in 1908. Nevertheless, it converted the Mahler skeptic Arnold Schoenberg, who wrote in great detail about his response to the work, stating unequivocally, âAs for which movement I liked best: All of them!âNote: both concerts are included on the Choral Union Series subscription package.

Description: After their UMS debut in November 2019, which featured Vivaldiâs Four Seasons paired with a new take on the work by Max Richter, violinist Daniel Hope returns with the Zurich Chamber Orchestra in a new program that takes a deep dive into the rich repertoire of American music, exploring its roots and distinctive qualities.âWe know a piece is from America the moment we hear it,â Hope says. âBut what makes it sound American?â With arrangements by Paul Bateman for solo violin with various classical and jazz combinations, this concert will explore some familiar and unfamiliar tunes by a variety of American composers.

City of Birmingham Symphony Orchestra

Description: Her tenure has been one of unqualified success, generating excitement among live audiences and critics worldwide. She brings the CBSO to Ann Arbor as part of a limited US tour with cellist Sheku Kanneh-Mason performing Elgarâs Cello Concerto, composed in the aftermath of World War I. The orchestra had a close association with Elgar, who conducted the ensembleâs very first concert over a century ago, in 1920. The program also includes an abbreviated orchestral rendering of Thomas AdÃ¨sâs third opera, based on Luis BuÃ±uelâs 1962 surreal film about a collection of society characters who find themselves inexplicably trapped together at a post-opera party. The CBSO âbrilliantly captured the profound, uncanny disquiet that makes [the film] so unforgettable.â (Bachtrack)

Chineke! Orchestra

Description: A new work by Carlos Simon, a U-M alumnus and Kennedy Center composer-in-residence, opens the concert. Fate Now Conquers was inspired by a journal entry in one of Beethoven&#8217;s notebooks and is based on the same harmonic structure as the second movement of Beethoven&#8217;s Seventh Symphony.Elena Urioste, who won first place in the Sphinx Competitionâs Junior Division in 2002 and repeated the feat in the Senior Division five years later, is the violin soloist for Samuel Coleridge-Taylorâs Violin Concerto, âbring[ing] the work everything it deserves: a rich, glowing tone, rhythmic panache, shedloads of charisma, and a tenderness that cradled the slow movement as if it were the most precious jewel in the world.â (The Arts Desk)Steeped in American folk music, spirituals, and church hymns, Florence Priceâs first symphony reflects her experience as a Black woman raised in the post-Civil War South. The premiere of her symphony in Chicago in 1933 marked the first time a major American orchestra had performed a work written by an African American woman composer.
