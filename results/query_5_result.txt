Much like it would be true to say that the Roadhouse is a barbeque restaurant, you could say that Natalieâs company, Alabama ChaninÂ® is a textile company. But that would be overlooking the nuances that make us both special. Weâre passionate about American foodways and dedicated to using great ingredients and supporting small artisan producers. Natalieâs passionate about slow design and zero-waste fashion and is dedicated to creating locally sewn garments and goods using organic and recycled materials. You might say weâre both all about community and preserving tradition.In her sixth book, Embroidery: Threads and Stories from Alabama Chanin and The School of Making (Abrams, October 2022), Natalie shares the origins and evolution of Alabama Chanin and the School of Making. Seamlessly pulling together seemingly disparate threadsâfrom personal stories to musings on the ethics of textile production to lessons in sewingâthis book is an empowering guide for all who love design and craft.Enjoy some of our favorite Roadhouse appetizers, while Ari Weinzweig, Zingermanâs CEO and Co-founder, leads a conversation with Natalie. Sheâll be sharing stories and talking about her newly released book. Join us to turn an average Tuesday into something special. Space is limited, so sign up and save your seat today.

An Ordinary Man: The Surprising Life and Historic Presidency of Gerald R. Ford

Description: Join the Gerald R. Ford Presidential Foundation and the Gerald R. Ford Presidential Library & Museum for an event at the Ford School hosted as part of the long-awaited book tour for Richard Norton Smith's An Ordinary Man. Richard Norton Smith will be joined in conversation with Hank Meijer to explore Richardâs new book An Ordinary Man: The Surprising Life and Historic Presidency of Gerald R. Ford.About the bookFrom the preeminent presidential scholar and acclaimed biographer of historical figures including George Washington, Herbert Hoover, and Nelson Rockefeller comes this eye-opening life of Gerald R. Ford, whose presidency arguably set the course for post-liberal America and a post-Cold War world.For many Americans, President Gerald Ford was the genial accident of history who controversially pardoned his Watergate-tarnished predecessor, presided over the fall of Saigon, and became a punching bag on Saturday Night Live. Yet as Richard Norton Smith reveals in a book full of surprises, Ford was an underrated leader whose tough decisions and personal decency look better with the passage of time.Drawing on hundreds of interviews and thousands of documents, Smith recreates Fordâs hardscrabble childhood in Michigan, his early anti-establishment politics and lifelong love affair with the former Betty Bloomer, whose impact on American culture he predicted would outrank his own. As president, Ford guided the nation through its worst Constitutional crisis since the Civil War and broke the back of the most severe economic downturn since the Great Depressionâaccomplishing both with little fanfare or credit (at least until 2001 when the JFK Library gave him its prestigious Profile in Courage Award in belated recognition of the Nixon pardon).Less coda than curtain raiser, Ford's administration bridged the Republican pragmatism of Eisenhower and Nixon and the more doctrinaire conservatism of Ronald Reagan. His introduction of economic deregulation would transform the American economy, while his embrace of the Helsinki Accords hastened the collapse of the Soviet Union.Illustrated with sixteen pages of black-and-white photos, this definitive biography, a decade in the making, will change historyâs views of a man whose warning about presidential arrogance (âGod help the countryâ) is more relevant than ever.
