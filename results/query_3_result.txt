Your Sexts Are Shit: Older Better Letters
Location: Arthur Miller Theatre
Date & Time: 2023-02-04T20:00
URL: https://ums.org/performance/your-sexts-are-shit-older-better-letters
Description: Tickets to these performances are at-capacity and sold-out. Tickets to Rachel Mars&#8217;s Our Carnal Hearts (Feb 1-4) are still available.Inspired by a serendipitous encounter with James Joyceâs raunchy sex letters to Nora Barnacle, Mars searched for other letters dating back to the distant past and compared them with salacious sexts from todayâs dating app chats, ultimately constructing a piece that serves as a meditation on the queer female body and a love letter to the lost art of letter writing. The end result is a filthy, funny, and intimate show that&#8217;s &#8220;dripping with uninhibited desire.&#8221; (The Guardian)

POSTPONED: Ty Jeffries (Thursday, April 13, 2023) | U-M Stamps | U-M Stamps
Location: 603 E Liberty St, Ann Arbor, MI 48104
Date & Time: 2023-04-13T17:30:00-04:00
URL: https://stamps.umich.edu/events/ty-jeffries/
Description: Event: Thursday, April 13, 2023 / Note: This event, originally scheduled for April 13, 2023 has been postponed. We are working to reschedule this presentation for the Fall 2023 series. Ty Jeffries is a prolific composer, lyricist, pianist, singer, and character comedian, whose critically acclaimed works are influenced by the combination of his classical training and his love of both the golden age of Hollywood and the Great American and British Songbooks. He is the son of the late British character actor, screenwriter, and director Lionel Jeffries, who is famous for starring in Camelot and Chitty Chitty Bang Bang. Jeffries is best known for his onstage persona of Miss Hope Springs, a blonde ex-Vegas showgirl alter-ego who plays the piano and sings cabaret songs. Jeffries plays Springs as a tragicomic ârecovering showgirlâ looking back on her life and career. The character is inspired partly by memories of fading Hollywood icons visiting his childhood home, as well as memories of him and his father watching old black-and-white films together. Jeffries won Best Cabaret Brighton Fringe in 2011 and was invited to open the new cabaret room The Crazy Coqs in London. Miss Hope Springs Sunday SoirÃ©es became an institution. Jeffries went on to be resident at The Matcham Room in the Hippodrome Casino (better known as The Talk of the Town where Judy Garland once played) and headlined at the Rah Rah Room in the old Pigalle Nightclub.  In 2016, Jeffries toured the United States with Miss Hope Springs performing shows in New York, Los Angeles, San Diego, San Francisco and New Hope, Pennsylvania, with an appearance at Lincoln Centre. In 2019, Jeffries won Broadway World Awards âBest Cabaretâ Edinburgh Fringe Festival for his show Itâs Miss Hope Springs. In 2021, he was invited to return to Wigmore Hall to perform a solo recorded concert for the iconic Pride 2021 celebration praised by NYC Bistro Awards. In 2022 Miss Hope Springs celebrated 10 years of residency at Crazy Coqs with a sold out rave review week of shows, and the residency continues into 2023.
