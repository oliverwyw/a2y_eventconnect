Description: A new work by Carlos Simon, a U-M alumnus and Kennedy Center composer-in-residence, opens the concert. Fate Now Conquers was inspired by a journal entry in one of Beethoven&#8217;s notebooks and is based on the same harmonic structure as the second movement of Beethoven&#8217;s Seventh Symphony.Elena Urioste, who won first place in the Sphinx Competitionâs Junior Division in 2002 and repeated the feat in the Senior Division five years later, is the violin soloist for Samuel Coleridge-Taylorâs Violin Concerto, âbring[ing] the work everything it deserves: a rich, glowing tone, rhythmic panache, shedloads of charisma, and a tenderness that cradled the slow movement as if it were the most precious jewel in the world.â (The Arts Desk)Steeped in American folk music, spirituals, and church hymns, Florence Priceâs first symphony reflects her experience as a Black woman raised in the post-Civil War South. The premiere of her symphony in Chicago in 1933 marked the first time a major American orchestra had performed a work written by an African American woman composer.
