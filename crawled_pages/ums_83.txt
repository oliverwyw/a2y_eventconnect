In 2020, conductor Dennis Russell Davies became chief conductor of the Brno Philharmonic, which was founded in 1956 and serves as a living tribute to Leoš Janáček’s music. Janáček was educated in Brno and spent most of his life there, and his extensive experience working with and composing for choirs was evident in his compositions.The Ann Arbor-based UMS Choral Union joins the Brno Philharmonic for Janáček’s Glagolitic Mass, a patriotic masterpiece and hymn to the Czech nation and Slavic culture. In addition, student members of the U-M Symphony Band will augment the ensemble for Janáček’s Sinfonietta, which calls for military bands and dazzling fanfares performed by an ensemble of 25 brass players, nearly double the typical orchestral work.&nbsp;
