Julius Eastman’s Femenine
Rackham Auditorium
2023-04-16T16:00
American composer, pianist, vocalist, and dancer Julius Eastman was young, gay, and Black when it was even more difficult to be young, gay, and Black in America. He died in 1990 at age 49, less than a decade after the New York City Sheriff’s Department evicted him and threw most of his scores and belongings into the winter snow of the East Village.Now, the Los Angeles music collective Wild Up is creating a series of performances and a multi-volume anthology of his music, starting with the 1974 minimalist work Femenine, which debuted two years before Steve Reich’s Music for 18 Musicians and Philip Glass’s Einstein on the Beach had their first performances. Eastman was dismissed for being ahead of his time, in the rejection of both his music and his person, but his works are now being unearthed to critical acclaim.
