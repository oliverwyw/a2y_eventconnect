Hill Auditorium
2022-09-16T20:00
Born in South Africa to a Black South African mother and a white European father during apartheid, Noah knows what it means to live in a divided nation, and he brings a unique perspective in his incisive social and political criticism of the larger issues at play in the U.S. and in the world today. His “Back to Abnormal” tour marks his first live UMS appearance after a virtual talk with U-M students that was open to the U-M community during the run-up to the last presidential election.
