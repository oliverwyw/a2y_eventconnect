You Can Dance — Outside! Ypsilanti: Step Dance
Riverside Park Pavilion
2022-09-17T10:00
This year, UMS is doubling down on the dance fun by offering two dance sessions! Each day will begin with a 45-minute Introduction to Dance workshop that creates space for participants ages six and up to ground themselves in the basics of the movement form. This will be followed by an hour-long Curious Movers workshop for participants ages 12 and up who want to deepen their dance experience through further exploration of forms and rhythms.Dance and music are highly tied together, and we find out just how much in these workshops. We’ll explore Step Dance, a movement style with a long-standing history of dance and music connecting as one. Through that movement exploration, we will deepen our understanding of sound and body while broadening our knowledge of this movement’s history and cross-cultural context.10 am // Introduction to Step Dance // Ages 6+11 am // Curious Movers: Step Dance // Ages 12+
