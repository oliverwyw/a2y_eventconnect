Michigan Theater
2022-11-03T19:30
Based on Richard Brinsley Sheridan’s The Rivals, Jack Absolute Flies Again is a rollicking new comedy that The Guardian called “one of the funniest productions in the National’s history.” After an aerial dog fight, Pilot Officer Jack Absolute flies home to win the heart of his old flame, Lydia Languish. Back on British soil, his advances soon turn to anarchy when the young heiress demands to be loved on her own, very particular, terms.
