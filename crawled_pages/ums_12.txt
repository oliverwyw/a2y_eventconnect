Over the past four decades Fleck has expanded the banjo field, earning 15 Grammys in nine different categories. But his roots are in bluegrass, and his first bluegrass tour in 24 years features some of the best of the new generation of players.This special double bill promises an incredible exploration of bluegrass from the best in the business.
