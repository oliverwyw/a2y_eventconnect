The singer, composer, and visual artist has a passion for storytelling and finding the connections between blues, folk traditions from around the world, theater, jazz, and Baroque music. She is an eclectic curator who unearths rarely recorded, forgotten songs with interesting power dynamics and unexpected twists; a composer of new songs; and a visual artist who works in the medium of textile drawings. Each of her past three recordings has won the Grammy for Best Jazz Vocal Album, and in 2020 she was named a MacArthur fellow. The New York Times called Ghost Song, released in March 2022 “her most revealing and rewarding album yet.”
