100 Market Pl, Ypsilanti, MI 48198
6:30 PM April 22, 2023
A new partnership brings performances and events for all ages to the Ypsilanti Freighthouse!  U-M University Musical Society and the City of Ypsilanti announce a new partnership that will result in arts programming for Ypsilanti residents, families, and schoolchildren beginning with this week-long pilot program, April 22-29, 2023. To kick off the series, the community is invited to join in song, led by Detroit native Dr. Brandon Waddles, a transcriber of Black gospel music whose choral compositions and arrangements have been performed around the world. This performance will feature four solo singers and piano, keyboard, and electric bass, this event brings the community together to sing both familiar and new songs. The house will open at 6:30 for participants to enjoy food and social interaction before the Community Sing.   In this two-year partnership, subsequent residencies will run for four weeks, with expanded programming for the Ypsilanti community. A community-informed programming process is the catalyst for these dynamic residencies, activating the unique and historic civic space for performances, arts learning and participation, and creative exploration.
