Artful Dining Experience
118 N Fourth Ave, Ann Arbor, MI 48104
7:00 PM to 9:00 PM May 4, 2023
Join in for the first ever Artful Dining Experience. A small and intimate event that includes a 5 course curated meal created in partnership with Monahan’s Seafood Market and dessert from Tasty Bakery. Each course is paired with specially selected mini-cocktails from Ann Arbor Distilling Co. and are inspired by works from the current Gutman Gallery Exhibition, Food for Thought, that will surround the participating guests as they enjoy their delicious meal. Liam Ayers of Monahan’s Seafood Market and a mixologist from Ann Arbor Distilling Co. will describe each of the courses and explain the ways they draw inspiration from the selected art works. The evening may also include a special visit from one or more of the exhibiting artists to share information on their piece. Seats are very limited as this is a small and intimate dining experience.
