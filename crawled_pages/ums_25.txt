Danish String Quartet: Doppelgänger
Rackham Auditorium
2022-10-28T20:00
Beginning as students at a summer music camp before they were even teenagers, the members of the Danish String Quartet have an extensive history of musical collaboration. For their third UMS appearance, they bring their Doppelgänger project, an ambitious four-year international commissioning project in which four composers create new works in response to a masterwork by Franz Schubert. In this program, they pair Schubert’s famous “Death and the Maiden” quartet with Pige(Danish for &#8220;girl&#8221;) — a new work by Finnish composer Lotta Wennäkoski, who has been praised for her mastery of color and musical textures.
