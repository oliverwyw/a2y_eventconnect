Join a Community Arts Forum to provide input on and ideas for the kinds of programming you’d like to see during these residencies. All are invited to this free event.Our first seasonal residency at the Freighthouse will be held in the Spring of 2023, and we want to prioritize programming and access for Ypsilanti residents. Our core purpose in this endeavor is to serve as an additive and supportive resource to the City of Ypsilanti by co-curating an engaging and diverse array of performing arts programs.During the forum, we will offer free pizza and light refreshments, share more information about UMS&#8217;s Ypsilanti Freighthouse artistic residency possibilities, and create space for you to dream with us, share your ideas, and give feedback.Please RSVP to let us know if you are able to attend and to dream with us — and if you&#8217;re not able to attend that night but are interested in being involved, please let us know that as well! Thank you for your time and collaboration.
