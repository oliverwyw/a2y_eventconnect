Hill Auditorium
2023-03-17T20:00
After their UMS debut in November 2019, which featured Vivaldi’s Four Seasons paired with a new take on the work by Max Richter, violinist Daniel Hope returns with the Zurich Chamber Orchestra in a new program that takes a deep dive into the rich repertoire of American music, exploring its roots and distinctive qualities.“We know a piece is from America the moment we hear it,” Hope says. “But what makes it sound American?” With arrangements by Paul Bateman for solo violin with various classical and jazz combinations, this concert will explore some familiar and unfamiliar tunes by a variety of American composers.
