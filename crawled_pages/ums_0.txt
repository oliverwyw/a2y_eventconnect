UMS Digital Presentation
2022-12-05T00:00
People say that in a time long, long ago, animals walked on two feet and spoke with words, like we do. And it was known that the cleverest of all the animals in the kingdom was a spider — the infamous Anansi — a trickster, a mischief maker, and the master spinner of yarns. Produced by London’s Unicorn Theatre, these classic West African and Caribbean tales come to life through the magic of digital storytelling.To complement this Digital School Day Performance, our UMS Learning Guide offers context about the story of Anansi, the performers, and the art of storytelling.
