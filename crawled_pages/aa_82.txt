One Helluva Ride
20501 W Old US Hwy 12, Chelsea, MI 48118
6:30 AM to 5:00 PM July 8, 2023
Join the Ann Arbor Bicycle Touring Society (AABTS) for a day of scenic bicycle touring over tree-lined, paved roads. All routes have been reconfigured for 2023 to maximize the quality of the roads we ride on. The routes wind through rural and recreation areas on beautiful rolling terrain and vary enough to appeal to a broad range of bicyclists. Options of 25, 44, 63 and 101 miles on paved roads and 22, 41 and 63 miles on gravel roads. Great rest stops and lunch after the ride.
