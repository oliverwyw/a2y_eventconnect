CREOLE DU NORD
301 North 5th Avenue, Ann Arbor, MI 48104
7:00 PM to 10:00 PM May 20, 2023
It seems that Louisiana Cajun music brings a real element of passion to this band. It became the mission of band leader, Mark Palms, who traced his family roots to St Martinville Louisiana, to bring the uplifting spirit of this music to his northern home. Dedicated to the traditional sounds of Cajun and Zydeco, Creole du Nord’s music captures the groove with fiddle and accordion backed by a tight rhythm, resulting in.. la musique pour les bon temps.
