2023-02-04T20:00
Tickets to these performances are at-capacity and sold-out. Tickets to Rachel Mars&#8217;s Our Carnal Hearts (Feb 1-4) are still available.Inspired by a serendipitous encounter with James Joyce’s raunchy sex letters to Nora Barnacle, Mars searched for other letters dating back to the distant past and compared them with salacious sexts from today’s dating app chats, ultimately constructing a piece that serves as a meditation on the queer female body and a love letter to the lost art of letter writing. The end result is a filthy, funny, and intimate show that&#8217;s &#8220;dripping with uninhibited desire.&#8221; (The Guardian)
