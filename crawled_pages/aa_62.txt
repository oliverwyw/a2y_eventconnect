Meet the Maker Pop-Up with Niki Lee Shipman
415 N 5th Avenue, Ann Arbor, MI 48104
10:00 AM to 3:00 PM April 22, 2023
Join us at Found to meet one of our favorite artists and makers--watercolorist Niki Lee Shipman who has been practicing painting for nearly 20 years, inspired by the artful energy in her hometown of Ann Arbor, Michigan, which she painted many times in her youth. Dedicated to her hometown and home state of Michigan, her paintings depict iconic city and university scenes as memories capturing the feelings of home, education, family, friends and the chapters of our lives. Her detailed paintings, hand-drawn and painted, take hundreds of hours to create. An expanded collection of her limited edition prints in varying sizes, each numbered and signed by the artist, will be available for purchase. They make a perfect gift for 2023 graduates or that special someone with ties to Ann Arbor or Michigan!
