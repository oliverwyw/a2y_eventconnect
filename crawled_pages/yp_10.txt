Fun Fest 2023
Rice St and Cross St, Ypsilanti, MI 48197
11:00 AM to 11:00 PM August 12, 2023
Save the date! This year, Fun Fest returns for its 3rd annual event at the Frog Island Park Amphitheater.   Join in for some Ypsilanti FUN! Come together with community to celebrate art, music, and connection. Enjoy live music, vendors selling everything from artwork to vintage clothes, artists of different kinds, food vendors, and more!  This year's artist lineup and flyer will be announced soon.  Stemming from the idea about how cool it would be to have a live show at the park, the first Fun Fest was organized in 2021 from the team who runs Fundamental Sound Co.    The event is free, suggested donations accepted.
