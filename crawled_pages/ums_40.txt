Ash Arder, UMS Artist in Residence, presents Whoop House (pronounced like “hoop house”), an art object whose role is to catalyze musical performance in the natural environment. It is an exaggerated staircase that doubles as a stage, meeting place, and solar energy hub. The work utilizes art and architecture as a framework to explore how humans interface with the natural landscape.This work-in-progress showing is part of a research and design process preparing the sculpture to tour neighborhoods in Detroit this summer. Stamps School faculty member Michael Andrews is utilizing Whoop House as a case study in his class, Social Spaces. His students will use the project as an entry point to discuss and imagine creative works that engage the community and their surrounding environment.There will be a closing reception on Thursday, January 19 from 6–9 pm, where students in the University of Michigan Creative Arts Orchestra will activate the work with a live musical performance.
