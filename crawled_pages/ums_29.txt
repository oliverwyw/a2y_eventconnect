UMS audiences may remember Aaron Diehl as the incredible pianist who appeared alongside Cécile McLorin Salvant. This new project showcases his fluency in both classical repertoire and dynamic jazz improvisation. He and his trio explore the connections between J.S. Bach’s counterpoint and the vocabulary of bebop, interspersing solo sections from The Well-Tempered Clavier with Diehl’s own music in corresponding keys.
