A map is a place which we all operate within, but it is only part of the narrative. The bulk of the story is stored somewhere invisible to us but within us. Oral tradition and bodily remembrance keep the ever-evolving story alive. The story we hold in us is unafraid of what cuts the map makes next&#8230;Musicians Kaleigh Wilder, Ben Hall, Jaribu Shahid, and dancer Alexandria Davis will explore Afro-diasporic narratives that traverse oceans and endure attempts at erasure. Using rhythm, movement, timbre, melody, and cacophony, The Story Cuts Across What the Map Cuts Up celebrates what could not be subjugated or relegated to the margins. A continuous performance of original compositions, improvisations, and movement invites the audience to imagine not the physical map, but the stories that connect and produce our futures.
