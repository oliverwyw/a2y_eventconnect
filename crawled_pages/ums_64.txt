2023-01-21T10:00
Children ages 3+ and their families can explore the store in a relaxed, child-friendly environment. Discover shelves stocked with thousands of original grocery items meticulously sculpted by hand, all made from discarded single-use plastics harvested from streets and garbage dumps. Kids and adults are also invited to examine the &#8216;life of their lunch&#8217; by drawing a still-life display of real and plastic foods. Use all your senses to observe and compare. Artist Sajeev Visweswaran will demonstrate techniques as we discuss the life of food and packaging in our lunches.
