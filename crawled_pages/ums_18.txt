Poetic and deeply personal, Salt is part testimony, part performance, and part excavation of collective memory through both archive and music. Throughout the film, she explores her painfully difficult but ultimately redemptive exploration of the Atlantic triangle, and in doing so, takes us on a cathartic pilgrimage through grief, race, and identity. Darkly comic in some places but also intensely sad, Salt is Thompson’s deeply human response to being both British and a descendant of a people enslaved by the British.
