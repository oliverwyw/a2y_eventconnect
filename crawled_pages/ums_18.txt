Her tenure has been one of unqualified success, generating excitement among live audiences and critics worldwide. She brings the CBSO to Ann Arbor as part of a limited US tour with cellist Sheku Kanneh-Mason performing Elgar’s Cello Concerto, composed in the aftermath of World War I. The orchestra had a close association with Elgar, who conducted the ensemble’s very first concert over a century ago, in 1920. The program also includes an abbreviated orchestral rendering of Thomas Adès’s third opera, based on Luis Buñuel’s 1962 surreal film about a collection of society characters who find themselves inexplicably trapped together at a post-opera party. The CBSO “brilliantly captured the profound, uncanny disquiet that makes [the film] so unforgettable.” (Bachtrack)
