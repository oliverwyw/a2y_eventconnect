Audra McDonald has secured her place atop Broadway’s pantheon with a record-breaking six Tony Awards, the only actor ever to achieve the Tony Grand Slam. Blessed with a luminous soprano and an incomparable gift for storytelling, she is equally at home on Broadway and opera stages and in roles on film and television (Private Practice, The Good Fight). A 2015 National Medal of Arts recipient, she was a founder of Black Theatre United in 2020 and is also a committed advocate for at-risk youth and LGBTQ equality, among other causes.
