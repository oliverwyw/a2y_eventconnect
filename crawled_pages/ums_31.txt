The group of visionary instrumentalists delivers her work with fire and swing. Formed as a tribute to Gil Evans, who orchestrated many of Miles Davis’s charts, Schneider’s band tackles lush and complex works that bring new energy to the jazz orchestra landscape.They perform selections from the 2021 Pulitzer Prize Finalist Data Lords, Schneider&#8217;s critique on big data companies for their impact on privacy and culture, with the composer conducting. Of the album, NPR wrote, “It amounts to the most daring work of Schneider’s career, which sets the bar imposingly high. This is music of extravagant mastery, and it comes imbued with a spirit of risk.” Time magazine also weighed in: “To call Schneider the most important woman in jazz is missing the point two ways. She is a major composer – period.”
