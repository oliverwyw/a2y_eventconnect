Like its title, this performance is a palindrome that you will be able to see both forwards and backwards. Because some people believe humanity is moving forward, while others believe the opposite. Some say the world is coming to an end, and others call them doomsayers. No matter who is right, in our quest for progress, we have dramatically changed the world we live in. Are our actions irreversible? Or can we undo them?To complement this School Day Performance, our UMS Learning Guide offers context about the piece, the history of theater, and more.
