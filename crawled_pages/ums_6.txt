Cultural Exchange Rate is an interactive live art project in which El Khoury shares her family memoirs of life in border villages between Lebanon and Syria. The installation is based on recorded interviews with El Khoury&#8217;s late grandmother, oral histories collected from her village in Lebanon, the discovery of lost relatives in Mexico City, and the family&#8217;s attempt to secure dual citizenship. The audience is invited to immerse their heads into one family’s secret boxes to explore sounds, images, and textures that trace more than a century of border crossings.Tania El Khoury&#8217;s previous work, As Far As My Fingertips Take Me, was part of No Safety Net 2.0 in early 2020.
