In Common

8:00 PM April 21, 2023 - June 3, 2023
Melanie is haunted by a voice that won’t leave her head. Call it a ghost, a hallucination, or clear evidence of a mental collapse. Either way, it’s a lingering reminder of a friend who was killed years ago; the friend was black, Melanie is white, and questions about why it happened – and who was to blame – come newly into focus when Melanie is drawn into a relationship that offers her a brighter future, but no clear escape from the past. *Contains adult language & subject matter Assistant Director: K. Edmonds Featuring: Caitlin Cavannaugh*, Rachel Keown*, Rusty Mewha*, Olivia Miller*, Dez Walker
