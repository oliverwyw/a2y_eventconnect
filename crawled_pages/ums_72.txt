Snarky Puppy

Empire Central is an homage to Dallas, with many of its songs inspired by the collective’s time in the city. And like the city, the eclectic 19-piece electric ensemble is big and bold, chill and laid back, rooted in its native culture while reaching forward. Led by Michael League on bass, Snarky Puppy was formed in 2004 by 10 friends who were enrolled in the jazz program at the University of North Texas. With 13 albums in 18 years that have garnered four Grammy Awards, Snarky Puppy has attracted international fandom for its detailed arrangements of fetching melodies, texturally layered harmonies, exciting solos, ear-candy synth effects, and propulsive beats. Its distinctly Southwestern influences — blues, hard rock, classic soul, modern gospel, percolating funk, new tech, fusion, and jazz — never sound derivative but conjure music that’s fresh and original.
