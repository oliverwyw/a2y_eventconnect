Olson Park Pavilion
2022-09-25T10:00
This year, UMS is doubling down on the dance fun by offering two dance sessions! Each day will begin with a 45-minute Introduction to Dance workshop that creates space for participants ages six and up to ground themselves in the basics of the movement form. This will be followed by an hour-long Curious Movers workshop for participants ages 12 and up who want to deepen their dance experience through further exploration of forms and rhythms.Afro-Cuban dance continues to have a global impact in connecting practitioners to the legacy of Cuba&#8217;s slave trade. With rhythms and forms that transcend the African diaspora, Afro-Cuban dance is one of the many expressions of culture, resilience, and pride that continues to empower practitioners and audience members through this movement&#8217;s ability to bring to life intricate dialogues of ancestry and homage.10–10:45 am // Introduction to Afro-Cuban Rhythms // Ages 6+11–12 noon // Curious Movers: Afro-Cuban Rhythms // Ages 12+
