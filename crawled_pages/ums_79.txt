This will be followed by an hour-long Curious Movers workshop for participants ages 12 and up who want to deepen their dance experience through further exploration of forms and rhythms.Little to no dance experience is required to participate, and workshops are free and open to the public. Register to attend one or both workshops – there will be a 15-minute break in between. We ask that participants 12 and under have a parent/guardian present at all times.Experience traditional West African movement to live drums.
