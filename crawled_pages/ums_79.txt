Since 1988, Wynton Marsalis has led the 15-piece Jazz at Lincoln Center Orchestra, which simultaneously honors the rich heritage of Duke Ellington and Louis Armstrong while presenting a stunning variety of new works from illustrious names, many of whom perform regularly with the ensemble. “You know it’s a good gig when you can’t tell if the band or the audience is having more fun.” (Milwaukee Journal-Sentinel) Following Friday&#8217;s performance of Marsalis&#8217;s All Rise, the group returns in its big band format for an afternoon of jazz.
