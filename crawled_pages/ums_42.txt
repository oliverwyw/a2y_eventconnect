Our Carnal Hearts
Arthur Miller Theatre
2023-02-01T19:30
UK-based theater and performance artist Rachel Mars developed the wickedly funny show as a gleeful and thrilling rummage through our darkest instincts, creating a space where our inner voices are given a megaphone and our competitive spirits are on display. A hit at the Edinburgh Fringe Festival, Our Carnal Hearts features Mars and four female singers in an ode to the humblebrag and other forms of jealousy, proving that the spirit of envy runs through all of us — and we wouldn’t want it any other way. &#8220;Not just honest&#8230;very funny, too, and streaked with regret.&#8221; (The Guardian)
