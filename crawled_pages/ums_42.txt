What Does the Sand Say?
Island Lake Recreational Area (Brighton, MI)
2022-10-29T13:00
Join us for an experimental eco-therapy walk and meditation on sand, breath, loss, and imagination. Explore sand as a cultural force, as a source of magic and dreams, as a resource that is mined, and as a bridge between the singular and the infinite.This event will include a walk within the sandy glacial outwash of Island Lake Recreational Area accompanied by a playful act of improvising facilitated by the A.W.E. Society, with the wind and sand sonically scored by musician Kaleigh Wilder. The walk and activity will take place on the dunes around the pond, and a safe distance will be maintained from the &#8220;reclamation area.&#8221;
