The Gilbert and Sullivan show, Patience, or Bunthorne’s Bride, satirizes the aesthetic movement, popular in Great Britain during the late 1800s, that emphasized ideals of beauty over practical considerations. Bunthorne and Grosvenor, two aesthetic poets, are pursued by rapturous local maidens who reject the devotions of a unit of dragoon guards. Meanwhile, Bunthorne and Grosvenor vie for the attention of Patience who is conflicted between the two. Grosvenor is her childhood sweetheart, but her idealistic view of true love as an unselfish act makes it hard for her to decide between the two. Hilarity ensues when the dragoon guards mimic aestheticsm, and Bunthorne threatens a curse on Grosvenor.
