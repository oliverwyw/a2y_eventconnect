The Plastic Bag Store
The 777 Building
2023-01-17T20:00
Shelves are stocked with thousands of original grocery items meticulously sculpted by hand, all made from discarded single-use plastics organically harvested from streets and garbage dumps. Several times a day, the store transforms into an immersive, dynamic stage for a film in which inventive puppetry, shadow play, and intricate handmade sets tell the darkly comedic and sometimes tender story of how the overabundance of plastic waste we leave behind might be misinterpreted by future generations — and how what we value least may become our most lasting cultural legacy.
